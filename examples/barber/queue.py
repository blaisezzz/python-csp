    """Guarded selection, as in OCCAM.

    In this form of ALTing, the GuardedAlt object is passed a list of
    callable / Guard (usually Channel) pairs. When select is called,
    the result is usually the result of a Channel read from a channel
    which has a waiting writer, for which the corresponding callable
    evaluates to True.

    For example:

        x = 3
        alt = Alt((lambda x > 3, c1), (lambda x : x <= 3, c2))
        print alt.select()

    will print the result of reading from c2 as soon as c2 is blocked
    on the offer of a channel write.

    Maybe this should be the default implementation of Alting? A great
    deal of code is shared between the Alt class and GuardedAlt. I
    have left this in, for backwards compatibility and efficiency, but
    it should probably be looked at again.
