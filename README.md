Installation
------------

```

or from a source distribution using setup.py:

```bash
    $ python setup.py install
```

Introduction
------------

python-csp adds C.A.R. (Tony) Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes to 
Python. A brief example:

```python
>>> @process
... def writer(channel, n):
...      for i in xrange(n):
...              channel.write(i)
...      channel.poison()
...      return
... 
>>> @process
... def reader(channel):
...      while True:
...              print channel.read()
... 
>>> chan = Channel()
>>> Par(reader(chan), writer(chan, 5)).start()
0
1
2
3
4
>>>
```
